# Neem-Leaf-Diseases-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning-Models
This project focuses on the detection of neem leaf diseases using deep learning algorithms, based on a newly published dataset from Mendeley Data. The work goes beyond classificationâ€”it also explores preprocessing and segmentation techniques to improve model performance.
 Key Highlights
Implemented and compared multiple deep learning architectures: AlexNet, GoogLeNet, DenseNet, MobileNet, and ResNet.

Achieved the highest accuracy of 90% with DenseNet, making it the best-performing model in this study.

Explored various preprocessing techniques and segmentation methods to handle the challenges of the dataset.

Integrated K-Means image segmentation to improve feature extraction. While K-Means helped in highlighting regions of interest, the accuracy remained around 90%, indicating that segmentation alone was not sufficient for boosting results.

ðŸ”¹ Research Insight
This research highlights the limitations of K-Means segmentation in complex plant disease datasets. Although effective for basic segmentation, the study shows that accuracy gains are minimal without deeper integration. A potential future direction is to combine U-Net with K-Means segmentation, which could enhance feature extraction and disease localization.
