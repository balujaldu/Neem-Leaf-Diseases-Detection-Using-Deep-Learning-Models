This project focuses on detecting neem leaf diseases using a newly published dataset from Mendeley Data. As part of this research, I implemented and compared multiple deep learning architectures, including AlexNet, GoogLeNet, ResNet, MobileNet, and DenseNet. Among these, DenseNet achieved the best performance with 90% accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness for this dataset.

Beyond classification, I explored various preprocessing and segmentation techniques to address the challenges of working with real-world plant disease datasets. In particular, I experimented with K-Means image segmentation, which successfully highlighted regions of interest but did not significantly improve classification accuracy, which remained around 90%.

This research highlights the limitations of K-Means segmentation when used in isolation and points to promising directions for improvement. Future work could involve hybrid approaches such as integrating U-Net with K-Means segmentation to improve disease localization and overall model performance.

This work has been published in IEEE and was honored with the Best Paper Award , reflecting its contribution to advancing research in plant disease detection using deep learning.
